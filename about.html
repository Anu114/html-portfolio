  At last thing is my love life ...
  in my intermediate 1st year exams, at that time one person's eyes were always me only. He loved me ..but as a girl, we have limits right?so I just moved on my way..my exams got completed i went to my home. here one thing happened that....I got dreem with him. I woke up the morning and realized that what is this like a QN? mark.and all vacations were completed and I went to college for improvement exams. for the 1st exam, I went to the exam center. the thing here is he also has the same center.I was shocked at the time. My hands and legs are shivering. one more good thing is he's in the same class as my exam.... so pretty no
  After that we are 2nd year of intermediate. no interaction with him after the all exam. in 2nd year we got the Dasara holidats. I am going home, he came to my college to see me.I went to the bus stop and I went home. after came back from holidays we had a farewell party. I danced at that party and we enjoyed it a lot. he always sat in my row to see me.I think once I just smiled with eye contact. he dont know I think. after that 2nd year was completed. I joined in degree college. I got a mobile phone. with my friend I got his number ..one day I called him in the morning. From that day to now we have been together.
